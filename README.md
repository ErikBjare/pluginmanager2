pluginmanager2
==============

Plugins are a vital part of many extensible applications and almost every program rolls their own despite many having similar requirements on their plugin systems. So, why not abstract it all away into a library and never rewrite another plugin system again? That's the purpose of this library.


## Goal
The goal of this project is to offer a generalized solution which can be used when a plugin system is needed in any Python program.

## Inspiration
 - [ZeroNet](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet) and their [PluginManager](https://github.com/HelloZeroNet/ZeroNet/blob/master/src/Plugin/PluginManager.py).
